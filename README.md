# 🚀 DSA Mastery in 3.5 Months 🚀

Hi there! 👋

This is my personal journey to **master Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** in **3.5 months** — just in time for placement season! 🎯

I created this plan after consulting friends at top companies like **Atlassian, Deloitte, and Cognizant**, and designed a schedule that is both **realistic** and **effective**.
