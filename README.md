# DSA 3.5 Month Complete Preparation Plan

Welcome to my Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) preparation repository!

I have created a structured day-by-day plan to master DSA in **3.5 months** — just before the placement season begins.  
This repository will document everything I learn and practice along the way.

---

## 📅 Plan Structure

👉 The repo is organized week-wise and day-wise:

- **Week folders** → `Week1`, `Week2`, `Week3`, ...  
- **Inside each week** → sub-folders named `Day1`, `Day2`, ...  

Each **Day folder** will contain:
- `notes.md` → overview of the day's tasks, theory and logic learnt.
- Solutions to all questions solved that day.

## 🏗️ Daily Routine

Each day is divided into 3 parts:

| Part | Time | Activity |
|------|------|----------|
| Part 1 | 1 hour | Understand the topic (watch videos, read notes, explore theory) |
| Part 2 | 2 hours | Solve questions based on the topic |
| Part 3 | 0.5 hour | Revise the topic / Attempt 1 test question with a time limit |

---

## 🎯 Weekly Mock Test

- Every **Sunday**, I will take a **mock test** based on the topics covered that week.
- This will help in revising and testing my understanding under timed conditions.

---

## ✨ GitHub Repo Usage

- I will be updating the repository regularly.
- You will find **theory**, **logic**, **solutions**, and **revision notes** organized clearly in this structure.
- Everything will be openly available for anyone who wants to follow a similar plan.
- I will be explain everything on my instagram account also. So don't forget to follow me on Instagram (@birajcodes) - https://www.instagram.com/birajcodes/
